# still running (for the headless ``-p`` fast-exit). Servers older than
# 0.3.0 don't model "waiting" — their ``SessionResponse.status`` is
# ``Literal["idle","running","failed"]`` — and 500 on ``GET /v1/sessions`` when
# they try to serialize the cached value. So we resolve the server version once
# (``_get_server_version``) and, when publishing status, downgrade
# "waiting"→"running" unless that version supports it
# (``_version_supports_waiting_status``). An unknown version — unprobed or a
# probe failure — downgrades too, so an old server is never 500'd.

    Auto-create the Kimi TUI terminal for a kimi-native session.

    Launches ``kimi`` (no args → interactive TUI) in a runner-owned tmux pane,
    then advertises the pane's tmux socket+target so the kimi-native harness
    executor can inject web-UI turns into the same pane (tmux paste).

    The pane runs with a session-scoped ``KIMI_CODE_HOME`` (built by
    :func:`omnigent.kimi_native_credentials.build_kimi_session_home`) that
    mirrors the user's global ``kimi login`` (symlinked ``oauth`` / providers)
    and adds the Omnigent tool-policy hooks — a ``PreToolUse`` deny-gate and a
    ``PermissionRequest`` read-only surface dispatched to
    :mod:`omnigent.kimi_native_hook`. The hook subprocess reads its routing
    from ``hook_config.json`` in the bridge dir.

    A background forwarder (:func:`omnigent.kimi_native_forwarder.
    supervise_kimi_forwarder`) tails kimi's per-session ``wire.jsonl`` transcript
    and mirrors each user prompt + assistant reply into the Omnigent chat, so the
    response shows in the web UI — not only the embedded terminal. Tool calls and
    reasoning are NOT mirrored (the embedded terminal renders those). NO MCP
    plumbing (upstream kimi has no per-spawn MCP config).

    Auto-create a Codex terminal for a codex-native session.

    Called when the runner receives a codex-native session via
    ``POST /v1/sessions`` or an explicit terminal ensure request and no
    terminal exists yet. Mirrors :func:`_auto_create_claude_terminal`: it
    boots a Codex app-server, registers the Codex TUI as a streamable
    terminal resource attached to that app-server, then runs the transcript
    forwarder so the chat and terminal share one thread.

    Fresh sessions launch without a thread id so the TUI owns thread
    creation; resume sessions launch with the persisted Codex thread id.
    The runner does not pre-create a thread, because ``codex resume`` of a
    thread with no rollout yet exits the TUI (leaving a dead pane).

    :param session_id: Session/conversation identifier, e.g.
        ``"conv_abc123"``.
    :param resource_registry: Session resource registry used to launch
        the Codex terminal resource.
    :param publish_event: The runner's per-session SSE emitter, used to
        surface the new terminal on the live stream (the Omnigent relay
        republishes it to the web UI) so the Terminal toggle enables
        without a refresh.
    :param bundle_dir: Materialized agent-bundle root when the session's
        agent ships a ``skills/`` directory, resolved by the caller
        (which has the runner's spec resolver). Its skills are linked
        into the per-bridge ``$CODEX_HOME/skills/`` before the
        app-server boots so the native Codex discovers them — matching
        the wrapped ``codex`` executor. ``None`` exposes no bundle skills.
    :param skills_filter: The agent spec's ``skills_filter`` (``"all"``
        / ``"none"`` / list of skill names), honoured when populating
        ``$CODEX_HOME/skills/``. Defaults to ``"all"``.
    :param agent_spec: Optional resolved agent spec for the session.
        When provided, its executor model is used as the Codex app-server
        default, e.g. ``"gpt-5.4-mini"``.

    Auto-create the native Antigravity (agy) terminal for a session.

    Called when the runner receives an antigravity-native session via
    ``POST /v1/sessions`` or an explicit terminal-ensure request and no
    terminal exists yet — the host-spawned (web-UI) case where no CLI
    client is present to launch the terminal itself.

    Unlike codex-native there is **no app-server**: agy self-hosts its
    control surface, so this boots agy directly in a runner-owned tmux
    terminal and runs the native RPC streaming reader server-side so the
    web chat view mirrors agy's conversation. It is structurally closer to
    :func:`_auto_create_claude_terminal` (the terminal IS the agent
    process and the reader is the single conversation writer) than to the
    codex path. The terminal starts agy immediately
    (``tmux_start_on_attach=False``) — UNLIKE the CLI launch in
    :func:`omnigent.antigravity_native._launch_antigravity_terminal`, which
    keeps ``start_on_attach=True`` for its human-TTY driver: this host-spawned
    path has no TTY, and the executor must be able to drive agy's first turn
    over tmux whether or not a web client has opened the Terminal panel (see
    the ``tmux_start_on_attach`` note on the spec below).

    **Permissions are web-attended, not headless.** The web client attaches
    to the agy pane through the runner tunnel and answers agy's
    ``request-review`` TUI prompt there, so the launch is treated as
    *attended* (``headless=False``). Auto-bypass comes only from the user's
    persisted ``terminal_launch_args`` (which carry
    ``--dangerously-skip-permissions`` when the user asked for bypass) —
    the same pass-through mechanism codex/claude use. A server-spawned
    launch must NOT key headlessness on the runner process's (absent) TTY,
    which would silently disable the per-tool prompt for a watching web
    user.

    Fresh sessions launch with no ``--conversation``: the runner cold-starts
    the conversation over connect-RPC (11a) so the reader binds agy's real id
    directly. Resume sessions launch ``--conversation <external_session_id>``
    (agy's real id, persisted by a prior run).

    :param session_id: Session/conversation identifier, e.g.
        ``"conv_abc123"``.
    :param resource_registry: Session resource registry used to launch the
        agy terminal resource.
    :param publish_event: The runner's per-session SSE emitter, used to
        surface the new terminal on the live stream so the web UI's Terminal
        toggle enables without a refresh.
    :param server_client: Runner's Omnigent server HTTP client. Used to read
        the persisted workspace, launch args, and the discovered agy
        conversation id (``external_session_id``) for resume.
    :param ensure_comment_relay: The runner's relay starter
        (``_ensure_comment_relay_started``). When provided, the Omnigent MCP
        relay is started against this session's bridge dir before launch so the
        wrapped agy sees the ``sys_*`` tools (#1194). ``None`` skips relay wiring
        (the ``_run_turn_bg`` first-turn fallback re-ensures it).

    Cold-start agy's conversation over connect-RPC and own its id (best-effort).

    The fresh-launch bootstrap: the runner mints the conversation over
    ``StartCascade`` so the executor's turn-1 has a real cascade id, instead of
    waiting for the agy TUI to lazily create one on its first typed turn. The
    connect-RPC port is resolved by
    :func:`omnigent.antigravity_native_rpc.resolve_cold_start_agy_rpc_port`:
    scoped to THIS session's own agy via its tmux pane (``tmux_socket`` /
    ``tmux_target``) so a host running several agy instances (sub-agent fan-out /
    shared runner) cannot ``StartCascade`` onto a FOREIGN agy and permanently
    cross-bind the session — the conversation-ownership check that normally
    disambiguates is not usable yet (no conversation exists). It falls back to the
    lowest ``Heartbeat``-answering candidate (current behavior) only when no local
    pane is reachable (remote runner), or once our agy is up in the pane but its
    port is not lsof-attributable; while our agy is NOT yet up in the pane it keeps
    polling rather than risk a foreign-agy candidate. This polls that resolver
    until a port binds, then ``StartCascade``s a runner-generated
    ``uuid4`` and writes THAT real id into bridge state (replacing the
    ``agy_conv_*`` placeholder) so :func:`read_bridge_state` returns the real id
    and the reader/executor address the cold-started conversation directly.

    The cold-started id is also PATCHed onto the Omnigent session as
    ``external_session_id`` (best-effort, mirroring codex/pi) so a later
    ``--resume`` reads it back and passes ``--conversation <id>`` to continue
    agy's actual conversation — the read-path replacement for the forwarder's
    ``_patch_external_session_id``. Only the fresh-launch caller invokes this
    (``if not resume:``); a resume already holds agy's real id, so it neither
    cold-starts nor re-PATCHes. As defense-in-depth (mirroring the CLI cold-start),
    this ALSO early-returns the existing id when bridge state already holds a
    non-placeholder conversation id, so it can never cold-start over a real id even
    if a future caller forgets the resume gate.

    **Best-effort, never raises.** A bootstrap failure (no port within
    *timeout_s*, or ``StartCascade`` erroring) must NOT abort the auto-create:
    that would leave a registered terminal with no reader (which a later
    ensure sees and returns 200 for, never self-healing). On failure this logs
    and returns ``None`` (the placeholder stays; the reader's discovery then binds
    agy's real id once a turn creates the conversation). The sync
    RPC/poll work runs in :func:`asyncio.to_thread` so the event loop is never
    blocked.

    :param bridge_dir: Native Antigravity bridge directory whose ``state.json``
        the real cold-started id is written into.

    :param server_client: Runner Omnigent server client used for the

        ``StartCascade`` port to the agy running under this session's pane.
        ``None`` (remote runner / no local pane) falls back to the candidate scan.
    :param tmux_target: This session's tmux target (e.g. ``"main"``), paired with

    Auto-create an Omnigent REPL terminal for a runner-hosted SDK session.

    Called when the runner receives a non-native (SDK-harness) top-level
    session via ``POST /v1/sessions`` and no REPL terminal exists yet. The
    terminal hosts the framework's own TUI (``omnigent attach
    <session_id> --server <url>``) in a tmux pane, exposed through the
    standard terminal-attach WebSocket so the web UI embeds it exactly
    like the claude-/codex-native terminals — with the Omnigent REPL as
    the TUI.

    The REPL is a pure co-drive client: it joins the live session over
    HTTP+SSE and dispatches turns to this runner, so the web chat view and
    the embedded terminal stay in sync. The tmux command is deferred until
    the first client attaches (``tmux_start_on_attach``): a session whose
    terminal is never opened pays only for an idle tmux pane, and by first
    attach the session is fully live (``omnigent attach`` fails loud on a
    non-live session) with the REPL sized to the real attached terminal.

    Auth parity with the native terminals: the spawned ``omnigent
    attach`` resolves credentials for ``--server`` the same way a
    user-launched CLI does (``OMNIGENT_REMOTE_AUTH_TOKEN`` env → stored
    OIDC token from ``omnigent login`` → ``~/.databrickscfg``), which
    holds because the runner lives on the user's machine.

    """
    Proxy a policy evaluation request from the harness to the Omnigent server.

    Called by the runner's ``proxy_stream`` when it intercepts a
    ``policy_evaluation.requested`` SSE event from the harness. Posts
    the evaluation request to the Omnigent server's
    ``POST /sessions/{id}/policies/evaluate`` endpoint, then delivers
    the verdict back to the harness as a ``policy_verdict`` inbound
    event.

    On failure (AP unreachable, non-200, malformed response) the default
    verdict is phase-aware:

    - ``PHASE_LLM_REQUEST`` / ``PHASE_LLM_RESPONSE`` fail OPEN
      (``POLICY_ACTION_ALLOW``) so a transient Omnigent outage does not
      hang the turn — these gates are advisory.
    - ``PHASE_TOOL_CALL`` fails CLOSED (``POLICY_ACTION_DENY``). For
      connector-native MCP tools the harness ``can_use_tool`` callback
      (which consumes this verdict) is the *only* enforcement point — the
      call is never re-checked server-side — so a policy that cannot be
      evaluated must not let the tool through.
    - ``PHASE_TOOL_RESULT`` fails OPEN: by the result phase the tool has
      already executed, so denying would only block an already-incurred
      side effect.

        Stop a claude-native session by injecting Escape into tmux.

        Claude-native sessions have no in-flight harness turn for the
        scaffold's ``InterruptEvent`` path to cancel — the harness's
        ``run_turn`` returns as soon as the user prompt is pasted
        into the tmux pane, and the actual long-running work (Claude
        generating a response) happens inside the ``claude`` binary
        in the pane. The only way to stop it is sending a key to the
        terminal.

        Sending the Escape is the whole job — no synthetic
        ``[System: interrupted]`` transcript marker is persisted. That
        marker exists for in-process LLM harnesses, where the runner's
        ``_session_histories`` *is* the model's next-turn context, so a
        cut-off turn must be repaired (dangling ``function_call`` items
        get synthetic outputs) and annotated. None of that applies to
        Claude-native: Claude owns its own session, the runner only types
        the latest user message into the pane, and Claude records the
        interrupt in its own transcript (mirrored by the forwarder). The
        web UI's interrupt decoration comes from the harness-agnostic
        ``session.interrupted`` event, not this marker. Persisting it here
        only forged a ``role:"user"`` bubble the user never sent into the
        AP-side mirror, diverging it from Claude's real transcript.

        Status is intentionally NOT synthesized here. The terminal's PTY
        activity watcher is the single source of truth: it emits
        ``session.status: idle`` once the pane quiesces after the Escape,
        and keeps the session ``running`` if the interrupt didn't actually
        stop Claude. Emitting ``idle`` here too (as this used to, back when
        the hook-based status couldn't observe idle-on-Escape) would
        bypass — and desync — the watcher's running/idle dedupe, and could
        strand the UI on ``idle`` while Claude kept working.

        Stop a codex-native turn via Codex app-server ``turn/interrupt``.

        Codex's own TUI maps its interrupt key to an app-server request

        should use that protocol directly instead of guessing at terminal
        keybindings: the Codex app-server validates that the requested turn is
        active and replies after the turn aborts.

        No interrupted marker is synthesized here. Codex records the interrupt
        only as a turn-status edge in its own transcript — not as a message — so
        injecting a ``[System: interrupted]`` bubble into the Omnigent mirror would
        diverge the web UI from Codex's actual session (and never survive a

        *own* ``[Request interrupted by user]`` record, which is real.

        Stop also cancels an in-flight MCP startup round (issue #2058): the
        bridge's still-``starting`` servers are marked ``cancelled``
        locally (what the web band and turn-error text read, even if Codex
        never acknowledges) and the app-server is asked to abort startup
        the way the Codex TUI does — ``turn/interrupt`` with an EMPTY turn
        id (its ``startup_interrupt``). This runs alongside the active-turn
        interrupt when both apply, because codex defers a mid-startup

        A server-side tool-policy ASK (the ``TOOL_CALL`` gate, e.g. a
        cost-budget warning checkpoint) parks and is published to the
        web UI as an ``ApprovalCard``. For a user driving the session in the native
        terminal — who never sees the web card — the Omnigent server forwards a
        ``cost_approval_popup`` control event here, and this handler pops
        a ``tmux display-popup`` modal in the pane. The popup resolves the
        **same** elicitation via the same endpoint the web card uses, so
        whichever surface answers first wins and the other clears. The
        server-side approval Future (and its decline-on-timeout → stop
        behaviour) is unchanged — this only adds a second answer surface.

        Best-effort: the modal is fired detached (it does not block this
        handler), and a pane that isn't attached / a tmux too old for
        ``display-popup`` simply leaves the web card as the only surface.

        or cancellation, ``failed`` on error), and schedules a
        post-turn buffer check.

        For a scaffold (in-process) sub-agent, a *successful* turn end is
        reported to the parent as the terminal completion only when no
        continuation is buffered — otherwise the intermediate turn's text
        would be delivered and the real final synthesis dropped (the
        already-terminal entry short-circuits later delivery). Deferring to
        the continuation's own empty-buffer stream end can't strand the
        result: every ``_run_turn_bg`` exit routes back through here, and
        ``_check_and_start_next_turn`` always starts a turn while the buffer
        is non-empty. The error/interrupt/cancel branches stay unconditional
        — those are genuine terminal outcomes, not intermediate narration.

        Cancelling the runner turn task (the proven primitive from

        the idempotency token: a natural completion that races the cancel runs
        ``_on_proxy_stream_end``, which discards the flag first, so this block
        then no-ops.

        Ensure the comment-tool relay is running for a ``claude-native`` session.

        Writes ``tool_relay.json`` into the session's bridge directory so the
        MCP bridge subprocess (running inside Claude Code) discovers and
        dispatches ``list_comments`` / ``update_comment``, then fires a
        ``notifications/tools/list_changed`` so a Claude Code instance that has
        already fetched its tool list re-fetches it.

        Idempotent and session-scoped: the relay is started once and lives
        until the session is deleted (see the cleanup in ``delete_session``).
        It is started from two places, whichever runs first:

        - ``create_session_terminal`` (the ``bridge_inject_dir`` branch), which
          fires as the Claude terminal launches — after the client has reset
          the bridge dir and before Claude Code's MCP client performs its
          initial ``tools/list``. This is the normal ``omnigent claude``
          path: the comment tools land on that first list with no notification
          race, so the notification is sent in the background (the bridge
          server is not up yet, and awaiting it would block the launch).
        - ``_run_turn_bg`` on the first turn, as a fallback for sessions whose
          terminal was launched outside the runner terminal route — including
          UI-launched terminals, which are never pre-warmed. Here Claude Code
          has already listed its tools, so the relayed tools land a beat late;
          the caller passes ``await_notify=False`` anyway, because a fresh
          UI-launched terminal's bridge has not published ``server.json`` yet
          and awaiting delivery would stall the turn ~15s on the readiness
          poll. The notification fires in the background instead.

        Relay-start failures are logged and swallowed: the relay is additive,
        and a failed socket bind or file write must never break the terminal
        launch or the turn that triggered it.

        :param session_id: Session/conversation identifier,
            e.g. ``"conv_abc123"``.
        :param bridge_id: Opaque bridge id resolved by the caller, e.g.
            ``"bridge_abc123"``. ``None`` resolves it from the session labels
            via :func:`_claude_native_bridge_id_for_session`.
        :param await_notify: When ``True``, await the
            ``notifications/tools/list_changed`` delivery before returning
            (warm-bridge fallback path); when ``False``, fire it in the
            background (cold-bridge terminal-launch path). Pass ``False``
            for codex-native: codex starts its MCP bridge server lazily (only
            once it runs the turn), so awaiting delivery on a fresh session
            blocks for ``post_tools_changed``'s full readiness timeout (~30s)
            before the turn is dispatched. ``tool_relay.json`` is already on
            disk by then, so codex's initial ``tools/list`` sees the relay
            tools without the notification.

        The native-pane idle reaper may reclaim an idle pane while a session sits

        pane and assumes it exists, so a turn arriving WITHOUT a client handshake
        (a sub-agent or API forward to a long-idle session) would otherwise inject
        into a dead tmux target and lose the message. This re-ensures the pane
        first. Idempotent: a no-op when the harness is not a native CLI harness or

        ``ensure_native_terminal`` path, so the pane resumes via the vendor CLI's
        own ``--resume`` (no fresh-start, no lost history).

          with uncommitted changes in the working tree (``git status``),
          regardless of which session wrote them.  Session-scoped filtering
          is not available in git mode.

        This endpoint is distinct from the directory listing endpoint
        (``GET /filesystem``) which reflects the current on-disk state.

        Returns the entry (a :class:`ResolvedSpec` or bare spec) rather
        than the unwrapped spec, so callers that need the materialized
        bundle workdir — e.g. skill discovery — can read it via
        :func:`_resolved_spec_workdir`. Resource access can happen
        before the first turn dispatches, so the harness process
        manager may not have loaded the session's spec yet; this reads
        the shared :func:`_session_snapshot` for the session's
        ``agent_id`` and reuses the normal ``spec_resolver`` path.

        A per-session lock makes resolution single-flight: a startup
        burst of concurrent callers resolves the bundle once and the
        rest read the cached entry, instead of each issuing its own
        ``agent/contents`` fetch. The success cache is keyed on the
        resolved entry only — failures are re-raised without caching so
        the next call retries once the agent binds to the session.

        agent.  It switches the session onto the new agent's os_env while
        preserving the workspace files:

        1. Closes the session's terminals via
           :func:`_teardown_session_terminals`, publishing
           ``session.resource.deleted`` for each so connected clients
           drop them (without the events the web UI keeps showing the
           old agent's dead terminal), then closes the primary OSEnv via
           :meth:`SessionResourceRegistry.cleanup_session` (workspace
           files are preserved).  The primary env re-materializes lazily
           on the next access from the new agent's spec, so the new
           ``os_env`` / sandbox / fork policy take effect while ``cwd``
           stays pinned to the same runner workspace.
        2. Drops the spec-derived session caches so the next access
           re-resolves the new agent.  The web filesystem/shell endpoints
           build the primary env from ``_session_spec_cache`` (keyed via
           ``_session_snapshot_cache``'s ``agent_id``); without dropping
           these the env would just rebuild from the STALE old spec and
           the new sandbox would never apply (a cross-agent sandbox
           leak).  Mirrors the turn-path switch reset.

        ``_session_agent_ids`` is deliberately left intact so the next
        turn still detects the switch and cold-starts the new harness
        subprocess.  This is a separate endpoint from
        ``DELETE /resources`` so the session-deletion contract (which
        also closes resources but never needs the switch-specific cache
        reset) is untouched.

        :param session_id: Session/conversation identifier,
