    :param title: Optional human-readable title for the conversation.
        ``None`` when not provided.
    :param kind: Conversation type. ``"default"`` for user-initiated,
        ``"sub_agent"`` for sub-agent execution conversations.
    :param parent_conversation_id: For Phase 4 named sub-agents,
        points at the parent conversation. ``None`` for top-level
        conversations. ``ON DELETE CASCADE`` so removing a parent
        cleans up the entire sub-tree.
    :param root_conversation_id: Id of the root (top-level)
        conversation in the spawn tree. Equal to ``id`` for
        top-level conversations. Indexed so ``sys_session_get_history`` /
        ``sys_session_close`` can verify that a target
        ``conversation_id`` lives in the caller's tree in O(1) —
        any agent in the tree can address any other by
        ``conversation_id``. ``ON DELETE CASCADE`` to keep it
        consistent with ``parent_conversation_id`` when a root is
        deleted.
    :param agent_id: Foreign key to the agent bound to this
        conversation at creation time. ``None`` for legacy
        conversations created without an agent binding (these are
        excluded from ``GET /v1/sessions`` results).
    :param runner_id: Runner the conversation is pinned to (hard
        affinity per ``designs/RUNNER.md`` §5). ``None`` until the
        first dispatch claims a runner; thereafter every subsequent
        dispatch routes to this runner while it is online (or fails
        with ``runner_unavailable`` if it isn't). No FK because
        runner records are not persisted in v1 — the registry is
        purely in-memory.
    :param external_session_id: Runtime-native session id this
        conversation wraps, e.g. Claude Code's session uuid for
        ``omnigent claude`` sessions. ``None`` for regular
        AP-only conversations. Populated by the wrapper bridge
        from the underlying runtime and used by ``--resume`` to
        recover the external session's prior transcript. Generic
        across runtimes — at most one external session per
        conversation. No FK because the id is generated externally
        (by Claude Code, Codex, Pi, etc.) and is not tracked in
        any AP-side table.
    :param workspace: Absolute path on disk where the runner should
        start, e.g. ``"/Users/corey/universe/src/foo"``. Required
        when ``host_id`` is set (enforced by check constraint
        ``ck_conversations_workspace_required_for_host``); optional
        for CLI-launched sessions that record their starting cwd
        for display. Stored as the canonicalized realpath returned
        by ``host.stat`` at session-create time; runtime symlinks
        are pre-resolved so the boundary check on the agent's
        ``os_env.cwd`` cannot be smuggled past via a symlink.
        Immutable after creation —
        designs/SESSION_WORKSPACE_SELECTION.md. When a git worktree
        was created for the session, this is the worktree directory
        path rather than the picked source repo.
    :param git_branch: Git branch checked out in the session's
        worktree, e.g. ``"feature/login"``. Set only when the
        session was created with a server-created git worktree;
        ``None`` otherwise. ``git_branch IS NOT NULL`` gates worktree
        cleanup on session delete. See
        designs/SESSION_GIT_WORKTREE.md.
    :param archived: Whether the session is archived. Archived
        sessions are hidden from the default ``GET /v1/sessions``
        listing (and the sidebar); the listing returns them only when
        ``include_archived=True``. ``False`` for normal sessions.

    SQLAlchemy model for the ``conversation_labels`` table.

    One row per (conversation, label-key) pair. Labels live in
    a dedicated table rather than a JSON column on
    ``conversations`` so per-key UPDATEs are atomic without
    read-modify-write (see POLICIES.md §6). The table is keyed
    only by ``conversation_id`` + ``key``, so it is untouched
    by compaction (which rewrites ``conversation_items``) —
    labels set turn 3 still exist turn 20 even after the

    :param conversation_id: The conversation this label belongs
        to. Composite PK member. Deleted with the conversation
        via ``ON DELETE CASCADE``.
    :param key: The label key, e.g. ``"integrity"``,
        ``"sensitivity"``. Composite PK member.
    :param value: The label value as a string, e.g. ``"0"``,

        coerces scalar / list values during spec load

    :param name: Human-readable name from ``config.yaml``, e.g.
        ``"corey-laptop"``. Displayed in the Web UI host picker.
    :param owner: User ID from the Databricks auth Bearer token
        presented during the host's WebSocket handshake, e.g.
        ``"corey.zumar@databricks.com"``.

        host that crashed without a graceful disconnect ages out of the

    :param token_hash: Hex SHA-256 digest of the launch token that

        (``host_type="managed"`` sessions) — never the raw token.
        ``NULL`` for external (user-connected) hosts. Overwritten when
        the sandbox is relaunched, which atomically revokes the
        previous generation's token.
    :param token_expires_at: Unix epoch seconds after which the launch
        token no longer authenticates. Scoped to the TOKEN, not the
        host — the host row is durable across sandbox generations; the
        expiry is set past the provider's maximum sandbox lifetime so a

        "this host is server-managed" discriminator.
    :param sandbox_id: Provider-assigned id of the sandbox currently

    A running per-user, per-UTC-day rollup of LLM spend, used by

    user has spent >$X today" sample policy) to read a user's
    accumulated daily cost as a single O(1) point lookup instead of
    aggregating the per-session ``conversations.session_usage`` blobs
    on every policy evaluation.

    One row per ``(user_id, day_utc)``. Incremented (UPSERT
    ``cost_usd = cost_usd + delta``) at each turn boundary from the
    cost write sites — but only when the session runs under at least
    one policy, so the table is never touched in deployments that
    have no policies configured (this keeps the shared server code
    inert against a database that lacks this table).

    :param user_id: The user the cost is attributed to — the session
        creator (``LEVEL_OWNER`` grantee), e.g.
        ``"alice@example.com"``.
    :param day_utc: The UTC calendar day the spend occurred, as an

        Bucketed by the turn's wall-clock time, so a session spanning
        midnight splits its cost across both days correctly.
    :param cost_usd: Cumulative USD spend for this user on this day.
        Starts at the first turn's delta and grows by each subsequent

    :param ask_approved_usd: Highest soft warning checkpoint (USD) the

        and written by the per-user daily cost-budget policy so an
        approved checkpoint prompts at most once per day (across all of

class SqlProject(Base):

    SQLAlchemy model for the ``projects`` table.

    Holds per-project *metadata* keyed by project name. Membership
    stays where it always was — a session belongs to a project via its
    ``conversation_labels`` row ``key="omni_project"`` — so this table
    is purely additive: a project can exist as label rows with no
    ``projects`` row (an *implicit* project), and a ``projects`` row can
    exist with zero member sessions (created via the projects page).
    ``list_projects_detailed`` unions both so neither ever drops out of
    the sidebar / projects view.

    The primary reason for a first-class row is the **description**: the
    per-project standing-instruction block injected into every member
    session's system prompt (the "functional projects" feature). A
    description wants to be longer than the 256-char cap on
    ``conversation_labels.value`` and lives at the project level, not on
    each session — so it needs its own home.

    :param name: The project name, e.g. ``"my-project"``. Primary key;
        this is the same string stored in the ``omni_project`` label
        value, so it is the join key between metadata and membership.
    :param description: Free-form standing instructions injected as a
