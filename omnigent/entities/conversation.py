@dataclass
class Conversation:
    """
    A conversation grouping related turns.

    :param id: Unique conversation identifier,
        e.g. ``"conv_abc123"``.
    :param created_at: Unix epoch timestamp of creation.
    :param updated_at: Unix epoch timestamp of the last
        update (item append, title change, etc.).
    :param title: Optional user-assigned title. Phase 4 named
        sub-agents store ``"<type>:<name>"`` here so the partial
        unique index on ``(parent_conversation_id, title)`` can
        enforce uniqueness within a parent.
    :param kind: Conversation type. ``"default"`` for
        user-initiated, ``"sub_agent"`` for sub-agent
        execution conversations.
    :param parent_conversation_id: Phase 4 — for child
        sub-agent conversations, points at the owning parent
        conversation. ``None`` for top-level conversations.
    :param root_conversation_id: For child sub-agent
        conversations, the id of the root (top-level) conversation
        in the spawn tree. Equal to ``id`` for top-level
        conversations. Powers O(1) tree-scoped lookups so any
        agent in a tree can peek at any other by
        ``conversation_id`` without walking the parent chain.
    :param agent_id: Foreign key to the agent bound to this
        conversation at creation time. ``None`` only for legacy
        rows or callers that cannot bind a conversation.
    :param runner_id: Runner the conversation is pinned to (hard
        affinity per ``designs/RUNNER.md`` §5). ``None`` until
        the first dispatch claims a runner; thereafter every
        subsequent dispatch routes to this runner while it is
        online (or fails with ``runner_unavailable`` if not).
    :param host_id: Host that launched (or should launch) the
        runner for this session. Set when a session is created
        from the Web UI targeting a specific host. ``None`` for
        sessions started via ``omnigent run`` (the CLI
        orchestrates runner spawning directly). Used for
        retry-on-reconnect: if the server restarts before the
        runner connects, the server re-sends the launch request
        to this host.
    :param labels: Session-scoped guardrails labels persisted
        in ``conversation_labels``. Populated by
        :meth:`ConversationStore.get_conversation` via a JOIN;
        empty dict when no labels have been written yet. Labels
        survive conversation_items compaction by design
        (POLICIES.md §6.3) — the two tables are
        independent.
    :param session_state: Mutable per-conversation key/value
        store used by policy callables to accumulate state
        across turns (e.g. running counters, audit trails).
        Persisted as a JSON column on the ``conversations``
        table and loaded by the policy engine builder at
        workflow start. Empty dict when no state has been
        written yet.
    :param session_usage: Cumulative LLM token usage for the
        session. Shape: ``{"input_tokens": N, "output_tokens": M,
        "total_tokens": T, "total_cost_usd": C}`` plus an optional
        nested ``"by_model"`` sub-dict keyed by the raw harness model
        id, each holding the same per-bucket token keys (and
        ``total_cost_usd`` when that model's turns were priced), e.g.
        ``{"by_model": {"claude-sonnet-4-6": {"input_tokens": N, ...}}}``.
        Typed ``dict[str, Any]`` (not ``dict[str, float]``) to admit the
        nested ``by_model`` object. Persisted as a JSON column and
        loaded by the policy engine builder at workflow start. Empty
        dict when no LLM calls have been recorded yet.
    :param reasoning_effort: Per-session reasoning-effort hint,
        e.g. ``"high"``. ``None`` means use the agent default.
        Set at session creation via ``POST /v1/sessions`` metadata
        and mutable thereafter via ``PATCH /v1/sessions/{id}``
        (alongside the runner-binding primitive of the Alpha
        runner-state design). Both paths validate the value against
        the supported set; invalid values fail with ``invalid_input``.
    :param model_override: Per-session LLM model override,
        e.g. ``"claude-opus-4-7"``. ``None`` means use the agent
        default from the spec's ``llm.model``. Mutable via
        ``PATCH /v1/sessions/{id}`` and the REPL's ``/model``
        command. Mirrors the persistence shape of
        ``reasoning_effort`` so the web UI and the TUI stay
        in sync — both read it from the session snapshot and
        write it through the same PATCH endpoint.
    :param cost_control_mode_override: Per-session cost-control
        switch: ``"on"`` activates the spec's configured cost-control
        mode, ``"off"`` disables cost control for this session, and
        ``None`` (unset) defers to the spec default. Set at session
        creation via ``POST /v1/sessions`` and mutable via
        ``PATCH /v1/sessions/{id}`` (the web "Cost Optimized"
        toggle). Read by the cost-control advisor pipeline at turn
        start; mirrors the persistence shape of ``model_override``.
    :param harness_override: Per-session harness override for the
        bound agent's brain, e.g. ``"pi"`` or ``"openai-agents"``.
        ``None`` means use the harness declared in the agent spec
        (``executor.config.harness``). Set at session creation via
        ``POST /v1/sessions`` (the new-chat harness picker) and
        immutable thereafter — the runner spawns the harness on the
        first turn, so a later switch would orphan the running
        process. Only valid for ``executor.type: omnigent`` agents;
        the create route validates against ``OMNIGENT_HARNESSES``.
        Sub-agent sessions never *inherit* the parent brain's override,
        so e.g. polly's workers keep their declared harnesses when the
        brain is overridden. A sub-agent session MAY, however, carry its
        own create-time override when ``sys_session_send`` supplied an
        allowlisted ``args.harness`` (gated by the sub-agent spec's
        ``executor.config.allowed_harnesses``); that value is set on the
        child's own row, not inherited.
    :param sub_agent_name: For sub-agent sessions (``kind="sub_agent"``),
        the sub-agent type name within the parent's spec tree,
        e.g. ``"summarizer"``. The runner uses this to resolve the
        sub-agent's :class:`AgentSpec` from the parent's
        ``sub_agents`` list instead of using the parent's spec
        directly. ``None`` for top-level sessions. Replaces
        ``task.agent_name`` from the removed task store
        (RUNNER_SUBAGENT_DISPATCH.md).
    :param external_session_id: Runtime-native session id this
        conversation wraps, e.g. Claude Code's session uuid for
        ``omnigent claude`` sessions. ``None`` for regular
        AP-only conversations. Populated by the wrapper bridge
        from the underlying runtime and used by ``--resume`` to
        recover the external session's prior transcript on a
        fresh runner. Generic across runtimes — at most one
        external session per conversation.
    :param terminal_launch_args: Pass-through CLI args for a native
        terminal wrapper (claude / codex), e.g.
        ``["--dangerously-skip-permissions"]``. ``None`` for
        non-native sessions, or a native session launched with no
        extra args. Set at session create (so the runner has them
        before it boots) and updated on resume via
        ``PATCH /v1/sessions/{id}`` (last-write-wins). The runner
        reconstructs the terminal launch command from these plus the
        harness binary; the command and all bridge / Omnigent / auth wiring
        stay runner-owned and are never stored here. A flat list (not
        a dict) is deliberate — there is no key for a user to smuggle
        internal wiring through. See
        designs/NATIVE_RUNNER_SERVER_LAUNCH.md.
    :param workspace: Absolute path on disk where the runner cd's,
        e.g. ``"/Users/corey/universe/src/foo"``. Required when
        ``host_id`` is set (enforced by a check constraint at the
        DB layer); optional for CLI-launched sessions that record
        their starting cwd for display. Stored as the canonicalized
        realpath returned by ``host.stat`` at session-create time;
        symlinks are pre-resolved so the agent's ``os_env.cwd``
        boundary check cannot be smuggled past. Immutable after
        creation — see designs/SESSION_WORKSPACE_SELECTION.md. When
        a git worktree was created for the session, this is the
        worktree directory path rather than the picked source repo.
    :param git_branch: Git branch checked out in the session's
        worktree, e.g. ``"feature/login"``. Set only when the
        session was created with a server-created git worktree (the
        ``git`` block of ``POST /v1/sessions``); ``None`` otherwise.
        ``git_branch IS NOT NULL`` is the gate for offering worktree
        cleanup on session delete. See
        designs/SESSION_GIT_WORKTREE.md.
    :param archived: Whether the session is archived. Archived
        sessions are hidden from the default ``GET /v1/sessions``
        listing (and the sidebar), surfacing only when the caller
        passes ``include_archived=True``. ``False`` for normal
        sessions; toggled via ``PATCH /v1/sessions/{id}``.
    :param search_snippet: Transient, list-only excerpt of the chat
        content that matched a ``search_query`` — set by
        ``list_conversations`` whenever the query hit an item's body (even
        if the title also matched), so the search UI can show *where* the
        session matched. Never persisted (not a DB column) and ``None`` on
        every non-search read path and title-only matches.
