"""Built-in cost-budget policy.

A single factory, :func:`cost_budget`, that gates a session on its
cumulative LLM spend (USD) at the **request** phase (before the LLM
turn, so text-only turns are budgeted too) and the **tool-call** phase
(the point a native ``PreToolUse`` hook can block before the action
runs):

- ``ask_thresholds_usd`` (optional, soft, **request + tool-call
  phases**): a list of warning checkpoints. The first time the session's
  ``total_cost_usd`` crosses each checkpoint, the turn (request phase) or
  the tool call (tool-call phase) is parked for user approval (ASK). Each
  checkpoint prompts at most once *per approval* — the highest-approved
  checkpoint is remembered in ``session_state``, so approving lets spend
  continue to the next checkpoint. A decline blocks that one turn / tool
  call but does not record the checkpoint, so the next request or tool
  call over the same threshold re-asks until it is approved. (Both phases
  have a server-side approval round-trip that applies the ASK's
  ``state_updates`` only on accept — the request phase parks the whole
  turn before it reaches the model, so text-only turns are warned too.)
- ``max_cost_usd`` (required, hard, **request + tool-call phases**): once
  spend reaches this, the policy forces a model downgrade. Rather than
  stopping the session, it DENYs **while the session is still on an
  expensive model** (``expensive_models``) — the whole turn at the
  request phase, or each tool call — telling the user to switch to a
  cheaper model with ``/model``. Once the session has switched off an
  expensive model it is allowed again — the budget becomes a "downgrade
  gate," not a hard stop.

It reads cumulative spend from
``event["context"]["usage"]["total_cost_usd"]`` — the running session
total maintained server-side (token-priced for relay/codex sessions,
billed directly for claude-native) — and the active model from
``event["context"]["model"]`` (the conversation's ``model_override`` or
the agent spec's ``llm.model``, resolved by the policy engine). When a
model has no catalog pricing, ``total_cost_usd`` is never written to the
session, so the policy would score the session at ``$0`` and never
enforce the budget. To prevent unpriced spend silently bypassing the cap,
the gate **fails closed** when token usage is present but
``total_cost_usd`` is absent: it returns DENY with a message asking the
user to switch to a priced model.

On the ``tool_call`` phase a DENY/ASK blocks that specific tool call
(the native hook returns ``deny`` / parks for approval) rather than
ending the session. On the ``request`` phase a DENY/ASK blocks the whole
turn before the model runs — so text-only turns with no tool calls are
budgeted (DENY) and warned (ASK) too; the verdict is surfaced straight
to the user via the same server-side approval round-trip. Cost is
refreshed at turn boundaries, so a single very expensive turn can still
overshoot before the next check.

    hand this reason to the model, which otherwise paraphrases it and drops

    that a user request to retry (after switching model) means *actually
    re-issue the tool call*: without this, the model treats an earlier "do not
    retry" as standing and, when the user later asks again, just repeats the
    cached message instead of re-running the tool (so the gate never
    re-evaluates against the now-cheaper model). The quoted message (a) names
    the high-cost model tiers so the user knows what to avoid, and (b) tailors
    the switch instruction to the harness: codex-native users can only change

    Identical gating logic to :func:`cost_budget`, but the budget is the

    (UTC)** instead of this one session's spend. It reads
    ``event["context"]["user_daily_cost"]`` (``cost_usd`` /

    engine-build time — only when this policy is configured (from the

    limit and the soft warning checkpoints both gate the ``request`` phase
    (before the LLM turn) and the ``tool_call`` phase (see
    :func:`cost_budget`).

    - **Soft (`ask_thresholds_usd`)**: the first time the owner's daily
      spend crosses a checkpoint, the turn (request phase) or tool call
      (tool-call phase) is parked for approval (ASK). The approval is
      recorded **per user+day** (in ``user_daily_cost.ask_approved_usd``
      via a reserved ``state_updates`` key the engine routes to that
      store), so an approved checkpoint won't re-prompt the user again
      that day — including from a different session. A decline blocks
      that one turn / tool call and re-asks next time.
    - **Hard (`max_cost_usd`)**: once the owner's daily spend reaches
      the limit, DENY every tool call while the session is on an
      ``expensive_models`` model (a ``/model`` downgrade gate, not a
      stop); ALLOW once on a cheaper model.

    :param expensive_models: Optional case-insensitive substring tokens
