"""Bridge utilities for the native Claude Code wrapper.

The native wrapper has two live processes that need to rendezvous:

- Claude Code, running in the user's terminal resource.
- The Omnigent harness turn, running when the web UI submits a
  message to the session agent.

This module owns the small filesystem rendezvous directory plus two
helper surfaces:

- An MCP stdio server (``serve-mcp`` subcommand) that Claude Code
  launches as a child process. It advertises Omnigent tools to
  Claude (workspace ``sys_os_*`` tools outside an active turn,
  active-turn Omnigent tools via a per-turn relay).
- A tmux send-keys path. Web UI messages are delivered to Claude by
  typing them into the same tmux pane the user is attached to;
  Claude treats them as ordinary user input. The runner advertises
  the pane's socket + target in ``tmux.json`` after launching the
  ``claude/main`` terminal.

Claude's experimental Channels MCP capability was the original input
path but is blocked at the org policy layer, so this bridge does not
use it.

    Pre-accept Claude Code's first-run trust + onboarding prompts.

    Claude Code blocks on two TUI prompts the first time it launches in
    a new context: a global onboarding flow (theme / login) gated by the
    top-level ``hasCompletedOnboarding`` key in ``~/.claude.json``, and a
    per-directory "Do you trust the files in this folder?" dialog gated
    by ``projects["<abs cwd>"].hasTrustDialogAccepted``. Neither fires a
    ``PermissionRequest`` hook, so on a host-spawned (web-UI-driven)
    session there is nobody at the terminal to answer them: Claude hangs
    and the web UI shows nothing. This is acute with
    per-session git worktrees, which hand Claude a brand-new —
    therefore untrusted — directory on every session.

    Seed both gating keys idempotently so the launch never blocks. Only
    those two keys are written; all other ``~/.claude.json`` state (the
    user's own onboarding choices, project history, MCP config, OAuth
    account) is preserved, and the file is left untouched when both keys
    are already set. This deliberately does NOT skip per-tool permission
    prompts — those still route to the web UI via the ``PermissionRequest``
    hook; only the unhookable startup gates are pre-accepted.

    Concurrency: this is a read-modify-write of a file Claude itself also
    rewrites. It runs once, before the terminal is launched (so Claude is
    not yet writing for this session), and uses an atomic replace. Two
    runners starting on the same host within the same instant could still
    race on last-writer-wins; the only consequence is that one session may
    re-show the trust prompt, which a relaunch clears. Matching this to

    Sum the USD cost of every assistant message in a Claude transcript.

    Reads the whole transcript and prices each assistant record's
    ``message.usage`` by that record's ``message.model`` (so a
    mid-session ``/model`` switch is billed at the right rate), summing
    the per-message costs. This is the forwarder's *real-time* cost
    estimate for a transcript whose authoritative cumulative cost lags —
    specifically a Task sub-agent's own ``agent-<id>.jsonl``, which has
    no statusLine of its own, so its spend is otherwise invisible to the
    cost-budget policy until the sub-agent finishes.

    Cost is linear in token counts, so summing per-message costs equals
    pricing the token totals — but per-message pricing also stays correct
    across a model switch within one transcript.

    **Deduplicated by ``requestId``.** Claude writes more than one
    transcript record for a single API response (a streamed partial plus
    the final record, retries, etc.), and those records share one
    ``requestId`` while each carries that response's full ``message.usage``
    (not an increment). Summing every record would bill the same response
    two-plus times — observed ~2x inflation, with the parent badge and the
    cost-budget gate both reading the doubled figure. So records are keyed
    by ``requestId`` (last priceable record per id wins, as its usage is
    the authoritative final figure) and each billed response is counted
    exactly once. A record with no ``requestId`` (rare non-API assistant
    entry) gets a per-record unique key so it is never collapsed with
    another.

    Deliver a user message into the Claude terminal via tmux send-keys.

    advertising ``tmux.json``, then Claude Code's input box rendering
    (see :func:`_wait_for_claude_prompt_ready`). The second gate closes
    a race on freshly-created sessions where the first message would
    otherwise be typed into a still-booting TUI and silently dropped.

    Delivered as one bracketed paste via ``tmux load-buffer`` (from a
    temp file) + ``paste-buffer -p`` so interior newlines ride as raw CR
    inside the paste markers and Claude Code's TUI keeps multi-line
    input as data rather than submitting on each newline
    (anthropics/claude-code#52126). A trailing newline inside the paste
    absorbs any trailing backslash — otherwise ``\`` + the submit
    ``Enter`` reads as a line-continuation and the message sits unsent.
    ``Enter`` is a separate tmux call. The file-based buffer
    path (not ``send-keys`` argv) matters: tmux caps a single
    client→server command at ~16KB, so a large message — e.g. a PR diff
    in a sub-agent dispatch — failed with "command too long".

    The submit is **verified, not fire-and-forget**: Claude Code
    coalesces rapid stdin bursts into a paste, so an Enter that lands
    while the TUI is still consuming the paste is folded in as a
    newline and the draft sits unsent. This helper first polls
    ``capture-pane`` until the draft is visible in the input box (the
    paste was committed), sends Enter, then polls that the draft left
    the box — re-sending Enter while it hasn't — and raises if the
    message never submits.

    Overlay a cost-budget approval modal on the Claude Code tmux pane.

    Launches :mod:`omnigent.native_cost_popup` inside a
    ``tmux display-popup``, so a user working in the native terminal —
    not only the web ``ApprovalCard`` — can approve/decline a cost
    checkpoint. The popup script resolves the **same** elicitation Future
    (via the same resolve endpoint the web card uses), so whichever
    surface answers first wins and the other clears. The popup reads AP
    routing (base URL + auth headers) from *config_file* so no token lands
    on the command line.

    Fire-and-forget by design: ``tmux display-popup`` blocks its tmux
    client until the popup closes, so it is spawned **detached**
    (``Popen``, not awaited) — the caller returns immediately while the
    modal lives on the attached client until the user answers.

    Claude-native resolver for the harness-agnostic
    :func:`omnigent.native_cost_popup.launch_cost_popup`: it reads the
    pane's tmux socket/target from this bridge's ``tmux.json`` and points
    the popup at *config_file* for Omnigent routing (base URL + auth
    headers, so no token lands on the command line), then delegates. The

    - Any other control byte below ``0x20`` is dropped: a stray ``ESC``
      (or BEL, etc.) in the content would otherwise prematurely close
      the bracketed-paste sequence on the agent's side.
