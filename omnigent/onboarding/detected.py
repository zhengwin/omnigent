"""Turn ambient-detected credentials into first-class provider entries.

:mod:`omnigent.onboarding.ambient` discovers credentials already on the
machine (env API keys, logged-in ``claude`` / ``codex`` CLIs, a local
Ollama). This module bridges those raw detections into the kind-typed
``providers:`` shape consumed by :mod:`omnigent.onboarding.provider_config`,
so they are treated as real providers everywhere — the ``/model`` readout
names them truthfully, routing uses them, and ``configure harness`` shows
them with no "detected vs configured" split.

Two surfaces:

- :func:`effective_config_with_detected` — a **read-time** merge used by
  the readout and routing: explicit config wins on name conflict, and a
  detected provider auto-becomes the default for a family that has no
  explicit default. Never writes to disk.
- :func:`providers_to_adopt` — the raw entries ``configure harness`` should
  **persist** into ``config.yaml`` (the actual write lives in the CLI,
  which owns the config file), so opening the manager adopts detections as
  ordinary, editable provider entries.
