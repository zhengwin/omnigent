"""User identity extraction from incoming requests.

Provides a pluggable :class:`AuthProvider` ABC and a
:class:`UnifiedAuthProvider` that supports three identity sources,
selected via the ``OMNIGENT_AUTH_PROVIDER`` env var:

- ``"header"`` (default): reads the ``X-Forwarded-Email`` header
  from a trusted upstream proxy (override the header name with
  ``OMNIGENT_AUTH_HEADER``, e.g.
  ``Cf-Access-Authenticated-User-Email`` for Cloudflare Access).
  Requests without the header are rejected (401) unless the server
  was explicitly started as a single-user local runtime
  (``OMNIGENT_LOCAL_SINGLE_USER=1``), in which case they fall back
  to the reserved ``"local"`` user.
- ``"oidc"``: reads the ``__Host-ap_session`` signed cookie minted
  after a full OIDC authorization-code+PKCE login flow.
- ``"accounts"``: same signed cookie machinery as OIDC, but minted
  by the built-in username+password ``/auth/login`` endpoint. The
  ``accounts`` provider is the OSS-CUJ-v2 default — first-user-is-admin
  with invite-only signup; see ``designs/oss-cuj/04-implementation-plan.md``.

Cookie validation is identical across OIDC and accounts modes —
both share :class:`AccountsConfig`/:class:`OIDCConfig`-shaped cookie
parameters. The provider is instantiated once at server startup
and closed over by route factories — no per-request import cost.

        The header name is :attr:`_header_name` (``X-Forwarded-Email``
        by default, overridable via ``OMNIGENT_AUTH_HEADER`` — e.g.
        ``Cf-Access-Authenticated-User-Email`` for Cloudflare Access).

        When :attr:`_header_strip_prefix` is set (from
        ``OMNIGENT_AUTH_HEADER_STRIP_PREFIX``), it is removed from the
        front of the header value first — e.g. Google IAP's
        ``X-Goog-Authenticated-User-Email`` value
        ``accounts.google.com:user@example.com`` becomes the bare
        ``user@example.com``. A value that is only the prefix (empty
        after stripping) is rejected, like a reserved name.

        When the header is present, its value is used as the identity
        (reserved names like ``"local"`` are rejected). When absent,
        the request is rejected (``None`` → 401): a missing or
        dropped proxy header must fail closed, never resolve to a
        shared default identity that every unauthenticated request
        would then share.

        The one exception is the explicit single-user local runtime
        (``local_single_user=True``, from
        ``OMNIGENT_LOCAL_SINGLE_USER=1``): there the absent header
        falls back to :data:`RESERVED_USER_LOCAL`, because the
        server's only user IS the local user and no proxy exists to
        inject identity.

        :param request: The incoming HTTP request or WebSocket.
        :returns: User ID from the header; ``"local"`` when the

    Defaults to ``"header"`` when the env var is unset — a bare

    header (default ``X-Forwarded-Email``, overridable via
    ``OMNIGENT_AUTH_HEADER``) — 401, fail closed; see
    :meth:`UnifiedAuthProvider._check_header` — unless the server
    is an explicit single-user local runtime
    (``OMNIGENT_LOCAL_SINGLE_USER=1``, set by the managed local
    spawn paths and the canonical bare loopback ``omnigent
    server``), where the absent header falls back to the reserved
    ``"local"`` user — the convenient posture for local development
    without minting cookies / typing passwords.

    Opt-in multi-user (accounts / OIDC)
    -----------------------------------
    Set ``OMNIGENT_AUTH_ENABLED=1`` (or any truthy value) to turn on
    multi-user auth. With no OIDC config present this selects
    ``accounts`` mode — the built-in login flow with
    first-user-is-admin setup. Set the ``OMNIGENT_OIDC_*`` env vars
    (at minimum ``OMNIGENT_OIDC_ISSUER``) alongside it and the same
    switch instead selects ``oidc`` — the native authorization-code
    flow against your own IdP. Containerized / remote deploys (Docker,
    HF Spaces, Render, Railway) flip this on in their entrypoints so a
    deployed instance is authenticated by default; a bare local server
    leaves it off. An explicit ``OMNIGENT_AUTH_PROVIDER`` always wins
    over this switch — it only governs the env-unset default. Deploys
    behind an SSO proxy that injects ``X-Forwarded-Email`` set
    ``OMNIGENT_AUTH_PROVIDER=header`` (Databricks Apps, oauth2-proxy);
    proxies that authenticate with a different header name also set
    ``OMNIGENT_AUTH_HEADER`` (e.g.
    ``Cf-Access-Authenticated-User-Email`` for Cloudflare Access — see
    :func:`resolve_auth_header`).

    (``OMNIGENT_AUTH_ENABLED`` is the renamed opt-in gate,
    commit ``b23e886e``, formerly ``OMNIGENT_ACCOUNTS_ENABLED``:
    header is the shipped default, so the var is an enable switch, not
    a kill switch. The old name is still honored as a deprecated
    alias — see :func:`_auth_enabled`.)

    Validates the source's required env vars at startup (fail
    loud) — OIDC fetches the discovery document, accounts decodes
    the cookie secret.
