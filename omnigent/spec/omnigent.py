"""Bidirectional translator between omnigent ``AgentSpec`` and omnigent ``AgentDef``.

Two functions live here:

- :func:`agent_spec_to_agent_def` — forward direction, consumed by
  ``OmnigentExecutor`` at executor-construction time.
- :func:`agent_def_to_agent_spec` — reverse direction, consumed by
  :func:`omnigent.spec.load` when handed an omnigent YAML so
  ``omnigent chat foo.yaml`` works transparently.

The bidirectional invariant
``agent_spec_to_agent_def(agent_def_to_agent_spec(d)) == d`` must
hold for every representative omnigent YAML; the round-trip test
under ``tests/spec/test_omnigent_roundtrip.py`` enforces it.

Design invariants (see designs/OMNIGENT_INTEGRATION.md §1 and §2):

- Tool callables are encoded as dotted import paths in ``AgentSpec``
  (e.g. ``"examples._shared.tool_functions.get_current_time"``). The forward
  direction resolves them via :func:`importlib.import_module`; the
  reverse direction recovers them from
  ``__module__`` + ``__qualname__``. ``AgentSpec`` itself stays a
  clean serializable native type — no opaque payloads.
- Unsupported concepts **fail loud** with an :class:`OmnigentError`
  naming the specific field. Currently unsupported (each is an
  omnigent spec gap to fix, not a translation to paper over):
  policies, OSEnv sandbox, MCP-type tools,
  cancellable_function-type tools.

    Translate the guardrails-related top-level fields of an

    ``ask_timeout:``); omnigent groups them under a single
    ``guardrails:`` block. This helper transforms the omnigent

    validation — so every field-level rule (phase/tool validity,
    action enum coercion, label schema constraints) lands in the
    shared parser rather than being reimplemented here.

    Returns ``None`` when all four inputs are empty / absent —

    Materialize a self-clone sub-spec by re-translating the parent.

    :class:`SelfAgentTool` entries from the copy (recursion guard
    — without this, re-translating would re-enter this branch and
    loop forever at parse time), assigns the cloned def the
    sub-agent's tool name, and re-runs
    :func:`agent_def_to_agent_spec` to produce a fully-translated
    :class:`AgentSpec`. The result is a self-contained nested spec
    the Omnigent runtime spawns when the parent's LLM dispatches
    ``sys_session_send(tool=tool_name, ...)``.

    The clone inherits everything: model, system prompt /
    instructions, tools (minus the self-clone tools), executor,
    os_env, terminals, guardrails, timers, async_enabled, etc.
    Other AP-side concepts that the parent has (e.g.,
    ``previous_response_id`` chaining, conversation linkage) apply
    at runtime through the standard sub-agent dispatch path —
    nothing extra needed here.

    The ``raw_yaml`` is forwarded to the recursive call so the
    parent's ``policies`` / ``labels`` / ``label_schema`` /
    ``ask_timeout`` translate into the clone's
    :attr:`AgentSpec.guardrails` block too — clones share the
    parent's guardrails by design.

    Recursion at runtime (a clone spawning another clone) IS
    supported by AP's standard sub-agent dispatch path, but the

    deeper parse-time clone tree is ever needed, lift the

        about what this sub-agent does, distinct from the
        parent's overall description).

    Translate an omnigent inline :class:`AgentTool` (sub-agent
    exposed as a tool) into a nested omnigent :class:`AgentSpec`.

    The parent's :attr:`ToolsConfig.agents` carries ``tool_name`` so
    the runtime surfaces this sub-agent to the parent LLM as a
    callable tool (matching the legacy ``functions.<tool_name>``
    visibility). The sub-spec itself is a regular
    :class:`AgentSpec` with ``executor.type == "omnigent"`` so the
    :class:`OmnigentExecutor` runs it when spawned.

    Lossy fields (not modeled on Omnigent' AgentSpec yet):
    ``max_sessions``, ``pass_history``, ``pass_histories``.
    omnigent' runtime falls back to its defaults for these on
    the reverse trip.

    :param tool_name: The YAML key under which this AgentTool is
        declared on the parent, e.g. ``"claude_worker"``.
    :param tool: The parsed omnigent :class:`AgentTool`.
    :param parent_profile: Databricks profile carried on the
        parent agent's executor. Used as the sub-spec's profile
        when the inline AgentTool omits one — inline agents in
        YAMLs like ``coding_supervisor.yaml`` typically declare
        ``harness: claude-sdk`` + ``model: ...`` but leave
        ``profile:`` out, relying on the CLI's ``--profile`` flag
        to flow down. Agent-plane spawns each sub-agent as an
        independent task, so we bake the inheritance into the
        spec here. Empty string means "no parent profile known";
        the sub-spec then falls through the same way its own
        empty field does.
    :param parent_harness: Omnigent harness carried on the
        parent agent's executor. Used as the sub-spec's harness
        when the inline AgentTool's ``executor:`` block is
        absent. Same pattern as *parent_profile* — YAMLs like
        ``coding_supervisor_with_forks.yaml`` declare just
        ``prompt:`` + ``os_env:`` + ``tools:`` on their workers,
        expecting the parent's harness to flow down. Pure
        omnigent resolves this at ``create_executor`` time;
        omnigent has to do it at spec-translation time because
        each child runs as an independent task.
    :param parent_os_env: OS environment on the parent agent.
        Used to resolve the ``os_env: inherit`` sentinel on the
        inline AgentTool — legacy omnigent resolves it from the
        live Session at runtime, but omnigent runs each child
        as an independent task with no live parent to consult,
        so we resolve at translation time. ``None`` means "no
        parent os_env known": if the tool said ``inherit``, its
        resolved os_env is also ``None`` and the sub-agent boots
        without filesystem access (matching legacy behavior when
        the parent itself has no os_env).
    :param raw_executor: The raw ``executor:`` dict for this inline
        AgentTool taken directly from the parent's YAML (before
        omnigent' dataclass parsing dropped unknown keys). When set,
        fields the omnigent :class:`~omnigent.inner.datamodel.ExecutorSpec`
        datamodel does not expose — ``auth`` and ``use_responses`` —
        are read from this dict and forwarded into the child's
        :class:`ExecutorSpec` via :func:`_translate_executor_from_def`.
        Without this, an ``executor.auth`` block declared on an inline
        AgentTool is silently ignored, causing child sub-agents to fall
        back to the ambient ``OPENAI_BASE_URL`` rather than the explicitly
        declared mock/gateway URL.

    :attr:`AgentSpec.os_env` directly.

    Harness-resolution precedence (first non-empty wins):

    1. ``oa_executor.harness`` — explicit declaration in the YAML's
       ``executor:`` block.
    2. *parent_harness* — the parent agent's harness, threaded
       through by :func:`_agent_tool_to_sub_spec` for inline
       AgentTools that omit their own ``executor:`` block.
    3. :func:`_infer_harness_from_model` on the resolved model
       string — mirrors pure omnigent' CLI auto-pick
       (``databricks-claude-*`` → ``claude-sdk``, etc.) so YAMLs
       that declare only a model continue to work under Omnigent mode.
    4. Error — when all of the above yield an empty string and a
       model is declared, the spec is invalid (no harness can be
       inferred for the model).

    Empty-string coercion mirrors omnigent' own dataclass
    defaults (``ExecutorSpec.harness: str = ""``,
    ``ExecutorSpec.profile: str = ""``) so the round-trip is
    bit-exact against the omnigent side.

    :param oa_executor: The omnigent ``ExecutorSpec`` or

        *oa_executor* has no profile of its own. Used by

        ``--profile`` flows into the child task's executor —
        otherwise Databricks-backed harnesses 403 on the empty
        profile. Ignored when the inline spec already carries a
        profile (explicit always wins).
    :param parent_harness: Harness to fall back to when
        *oa_executor* has no harness of its own. Matches the
        profile fallback's semantics — inline-AgentTool sub-
        specs that omit ``executor:`` rely on the parent's
        harness, and the validator requires harness to be one
        of the supported set so an empty string fails
        hard there.
    :param raw_executor: Optional raw YAML ``executor:`` mapping.
        When present, ``use_responses`` (``bool | None``) is read
        from it and forwarded into ``executor.config["use_responses"]``
