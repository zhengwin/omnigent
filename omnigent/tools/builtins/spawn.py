class SysSessionSendTool(Tool):
    """
    Send a message to a named sub-agent — auto-create-or-continue.

    Sub-agent sessions are separate Omnigent agent sessions (own
    conversation, visible in the session tree) — distinct from any
    built-in subagent/Task tool the wrapping harness provides.

    Two addressing modes:

    - **Named** — pass ``(agent, title)``. The first call with a
      pair creates the child conversation and starts a turn;
      subsequent calls with the same pair continue it (the
      sub-agent sees its full prior history plus the new ``args``).
    - **By session id** — pass ``session_id`` to post to an
      **existing** child session (e.g. one returned by
      ``sys_session_create``). This is a child-only write: the
      target must be a direct child of the caller
      (``parent_session_id == caller``), so an orchestrator can
      only drive sessions inside its own subtree.

    Exactly one of ``(agent + title)`` or ``session_id`` must be
    given, always with ``args``.

    Returns a JSON handle in the same shape as
    :class:`omnigent.runtime.workflow._AsyncToolHandle`:
    ``{task_id, kind: "sub_agent", agent, title, conversation_id,
    status, message}``. The result auto-delivers via the unified
    ``async_work_complete`` topic; the LLM can abort with
    ``sys_cancel_task`` if it wants to stop early.

    Errors:

    - ``unknown sub-agent type`` — ``agent`` is not one of the
      declared sub-agent names.
    - ``sub_agent_busy`` — the existing session has a non-terminal
      task already running. Wait for completion (it auto-delivers
      via the drain) or cancel before sending again.
    - ``model`` rejections — the optional ``args.model`` override is
      create-time-only and only valid for harnesses with model
      plumbing; sends that pass it to an existing session, an
      unplumbed harness, or with a malformed id return an error.

    There is no ``name_already_exists`` error in this merged tool
    — a pre-existing ``(agent, title)`` is the expected case
    (continuation), not a conflict. To force a fresh child for
    the same logical title, call :class:`SysSessionCloseTool`
    first to tombstone the existing one.

    """
    Create a child session from an existing agent or a local bundle.

    The child is a separate Omnigent agent session — its own
    conversation, visible in the session tree, optionally a different
    registered agent — not the wrapping harness's built-in
    subagent/Task tool (which remains the right choice for quick
    in-context helpers).

    A **child-only write**: the new session's ``parent_session_id`` is
    forced to the caller's own session, so an orchestrator can only spawn
    sessions inside its own subtree — never a top-level or sibling
    session. The child inherits the caller's runner (co-location), so it
    starts executing as soon as a message is queued.

    Two addressing modes — exactly one of ``agent_id`` or
    ``config_path`` must be given:

    - **By agent id** — an existing agent the caller can see (a
      built-in/template or session-bound entry from ``sys_agent_list``
      — both row kinds carry an ``agent_id`` — or the agent bound to
      an accessible session via ``sys_agent_get``). Proxies the JSON
      ``POST /v1/sessions`` create. The direct path for any
      already-registered agent: no bundle download or re-upload.
    - **By config path** — a NEW agent uploaded from local disk: an
      agent config YAML, agent directory, or pre-built ``.tar.gz``
      bundle inside the caller's working directory (e.g. one authored
      with ``sys_os_write``). The runner bundles the source and
      proxies the multipart ``POST /v1/sessions`` create, registering
      a fresh session-scoped agent.

    An optional ``message`` is queued as the child's first user turn;
    an optional ``title`` labels the session.

    Returns a handle ``{conversation_id, agent_id, title, status}``. The
    session runs asynchronously — use ``sys_session_get_history`` /
    ``sys_session_get_info`` to monitor it, or ``sys_session_send`` (with
    the returned ``conversation_id``) to drive it further.

    Runner-dispatched: both modes force ``parent_session_id`` to the
    caller.

    Tombstone any sibling sub-agent session in the same spawn tree.

    The LLM uses ``sys_session_close`` to declare that a
    sub-agent conversation is finished. The child's title is
    rewritten so future ``sys_session_send`` calls with the same
    ``(agent, title)`` no longer find it and create a fresh
    child instead. Tree-scoping is enforced by the tool on both
    dispatch paths — the in-process path here and the runner's
    REST path (``_session_close_via_rest``): callers can only
    close sub-agent conversations sharing their
    ``root_conversation_id``. Because close is a write, this gate
    is stricter than the bare per-user edit permission the
    underlying PATCH route enforces — edit access to a session in
    a *different* spawn tree is not enough to close it.

    The close marker is non-destructive: the child conversation's
    items remain in the store and can still be read by id (e.g. via
    the server REST API). User-input write paths reject closed
    children, and the ``(parent, title)`` lookup path is closed off.

    Refuses to tombstone a session whose child has a non-terminal
    task in flight (returns ``sub_agent_busy``) — closing during a
    live turn would leave a running child orphaned from the
