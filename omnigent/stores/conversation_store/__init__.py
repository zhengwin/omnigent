# Label set on a fork of a session that had a working directory. Its
# value is the source session id. Presence marks the (unbound) clone as
# needing a host + working directory before it can run, so the
# online-dot reports it offline until bound and the UI opens the
# directory picker instead of silently dropping the first message.
# Forks of chat-only sources (no workspace) get no label and resume
# in-process like a brand-new chat session. Canonical home is the store
# layer; the server route and the SQLAlchemy store both import it.
FORK_SOURCE_LABEL_KEY = "omnigent.fork.source_id"

# One-shot fork directive: the SOURCE session's runtime-native session id
# (e.g. the source claude-native Claude Code session uuid), stamped on the
# clone at fork time when the source had one. A native harness launching
# the (still-unbound) clone uses it to locate the source's local transcript
# and clone it into the clone's OWN project dir under a freshly assigned
# uuid (rewriting sessionId/cwd), then launch plain ``--resume <our_uuid>``
# (see ``omnigent.claude_native._clone_claude_transcript`` and the
# fork-resume branch in ``omnigent.runner.app``), so the clone opens with
# the prior history instead of a blank session. Once the clone captures its
# OWN native session id (``external_session_id`` set on first launch), this
# directive is inert — the launch path only consults it while
# ``external_session_id`` is still NULL. Cleared/ignored thereafter.
FORK_SOURCE_EXTERNAL_SESSION_LABEL_KEY = "omnigent.fork.source_external_session_id"

# Fork directive: set when the fork binds a NATIVE target harness
# (claude-native / codex-native) whose history should carry over. A native
# CLI ignores the Omnigent transcript, so the runner rebuilds the target's
# on-disk transcript before launch. Two rebuild paths share this directive:
# when the source was a SAME-FAMILY native session its captured
# ``external_session_id`` is also stamped (see
# FORK_SOURCE_EXTERNAL_SESSION_LABEL_KEY) and the runner clones that
# transcript; otherwise (an SDK or cross-family source) the runner builds
# the native transcript from the fork's copied Omnigent items
# (``_ensure_local_claude_resume_transcript`` /
# ``_ensure_local_codex_resume_rollout`` — the converters consume Omnigent's
# normalized item shape, so the source harness doesn't matter). Set by the
# route whenever the target is native. Inert once the clone captures its
# own native session id (the launch path consults it only while
# ``external_session_id`` is NULL).
FORK_CARRY_HISTORY_LABEL_KEY = "omnigent.fork.carry_history"

# Set by an in-place agent switch (``POST /v1/sessions/{id}/switch-agent``):
# the BUILT-IN agent id the session was switched away from, so the UI can
# offer a one-click "Switch back". A convenience pointer only — switching
# back is a fresh re-clone of that built-in (a new session-scoped agent,
# fresh harness), not a transactional undo. Persisted (not instance-scoped),
# so it survives across turns and is overwritten by each subsequent switch.
SWITCH_PREVIOUS_BUILTIN_LABEL_KEY = "omnigent.switch.previous_builtin_id"

# Opt-in DANGEROUS launch directive for a codex-native session: when set to
# ``"1"`` the runner launches Codex with
# ``--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`` and puts the app-server
# threads into the matching no-approval / no-sandbox stance (see
# ``omnigent.runner.app._codex_native_launch_config`` and
# ``codex_native_app_server.build_codex_remote_args``). Stored as a plain
# conversation label (cheap thread metadata, like the fork directives above)
# so it survives reload without a schema migration. The web UI gates turning
# this on behind a typed confirmation + a persistent red warning banner; any
# value other than ``"1"`` (incl. absent) leaves the session in Codex's
# normal approval/sandbox stance. See issue #657.
CODEX_NATIVE_BYPASS_SANDBOX_LABEL_KEY = "omnigent.codex_native.bypass_sandbox"

# Reserved label key that stores a session's sidebar "project" membership
# (implicit collections — a project exists while ≥1 session carries this key).
# Namespaced so it never collides with the user-facing "project" term or other
# reserved keys, and is filtered out of generic label surfaces. Canonical home
# is the store layer; the SQLAlchemy store and the server route both import it,
# and the web client mirrors the literal as ``PROJECT_LABEL_KEY``.
PROJECT_LABEL_KEY = "omni_project"

# Labels that must NOT cross into a new session context — deliberately
# dropped both when forking (not copied to the clone) and on an in-place
# agent switch (deleted from the switched session). Two distinct reasons
# put a key here:
#
#   * Runtime state bound to ONE running instance — the native bridge-id
#     labels would route the new context's terminal + web injection to the
#     SOURCE's claude/codex bridge (whose active-session marker isn't the
#     clone → "session no longer active"); the context-size metrics would
#     display the source's last usage. The bridge-id literals mirror the
#     harness modules' ``*_BRIDGE_ID_LABEL_KEY`` constants; a store test
#     cross-checks them so a rename in those modules fails loudly here.
#
#   * Per-context safety opt-in — the DANGEROUS codex full-bypass directive
#     (:data:`CODEX_NATIVE_BYPASS_SANDBOX_LABEL_KEY`). Letting it ride into a
#     fork (a new session + workspace) or survive an agent switch would
#     silently re-arm ``--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`` with no
#     typed re-confirmation and no banner, violating the "impossible to
#     enable accidentally" contract (#657). Dropping it forces each session
#     that runs bypass to make its own explicit opt-in.

            whose bound ``conversations.agent_id`` points at an

            ``None`` — i.e. sessions created via

            filter is disabled. Powers the ``GET /v1/sessions``
            list endpoint.

            conversations are excluded. When ``True``, archived and

            native transcript from the copied Omnigent items instead.

            directive so a native target rebuilds its transcript from the
            truncated items instead of resuming the full source
            transcript; when the response is the source's last one, the
            copy is equivalent to a full fork and the directive is kept.
            ``None`` (default) copies the full history.

        Rebind a session in place to a different (cloned) agent.

        Unlike :meth:`fork_conversation`, this mutates the SAME
        conversation row — the transcript, comments, files, host,
        and workspace are untouched; only the agent/harness changes.
        In one transaction it: deletes the session's current
        session-scoped agent (the unique ``session_id`` index forbids
        two agents on one session, so the old must go before the new
        binds), creates a new session-scoped agent from the supplied
        bundle, points ``agent_id`` at it, applies the model-settings
        and label deltas below, and clears ``external_session_id``
        (the old harness's native runtime state). The whole operation
        is atomic: any failure rolls back and the session stays on its
        current agent.

        :param conversation_id: Session to switch, e.g.
            ``"conv_abc123"``.

            session-scoped agent, e.g. ``"ag_def456"``.

            target built-in's bundle to clone, e.g.
            ``"ag_builtin/abcd1234"``.
        :param new_agent_description: Optional description from the
            target's spec. ``None`` leaves the column NULL.
        :param copy_model_settings: When ``True``, keep the session's
            existing ``model_override`` / ``reasoning_effort`` (the
            switch stays in the same provider family). When ``False``,
            both are reset to ``None`` so the new agent's defaults
            apply (a cross-family switch — a model id is provider-bound).
        :param carry_history_into_native: When ``True``, stamp
            :data:`FORK_CARRY_HISTORY_LABEL_KEY` so a native target
            rebuilds its transcript from this session's own AP items on
            the next turn; when ``False``, that label is removed. Set by
            the route only when the target is native AND same-family.
        :param presentation_labels: Replace the session's
            ``omnigent.ui`` / ``omnigent.wrapper`` labels with these so
            the UI mode matches the TARGET harness (native →
            ``{ui: terminal, wrapper: ...}``; SDK → ``{}`` → chat mode).
        :param previous_builtin_id: Built-in agent id the session is
            switching away from, stamped as
            :data:`SWITCH_PREVIOUS_BUILTIN_LABEL_KEY` for a one-click
            "Switch back". ``None`` leaves it unset.
