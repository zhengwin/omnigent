"""
Tests for the unified builtin tool registry (POLICIES.md §15.8).

Phase 2 unification: `BUILTIN_NAMES` and the instantiable
subset both derive from a single `_BUILTIN_REGISTRY` dict,
with `None` factories marking framework-owned names
(``web_fetch``).

These tests lock the name-space invariants so any future
registry change has to either deliberately touch them or
break loudly.
