"""End-to-end runner-dispatch tests: server → runner → spawned harness.

The load-bearing assertion: the runner FastAPI app, when given a
real :class:`HarnessProcessManager`, accepts a
POST /v1/sessions/{conversation_id}/events?stream=true,
spawns a harness subprocess (using the existing
``omnigent/runtime/harnesses/`` machinery — NOT a parallel impl),
forwards the request to the harness via UDS, and streams the
harness's SSE response back through the runner's own SSE response.

Architecture verified end-to-end:
- A real ``HarnessProcessManager`` is started (writes its instance
  dir, runs orphan sweep, starts the idle reaper).
- A test-only harness module is registered in ``_HARNESS_MODULES``.
- The runner FastAPI app is built with ``process_manager=mgr``.
- The test posts to the runner's
  /v1/sessions/{conversation_id}/events?stream=true with a message
  body + harness name.
- The runner calls ``mgr.get_client()`` → spawns a uvicorn
  subprocess running the test harness on a UDS → returns the
  per-conversation httpx client.
- The runner POSTs the request to the harness via that client.
- The harness drives an LLM call via ``run_turn`` and streams SSE
  back.
- The runner relays each SSE chunk through to the test client.

The OpenAI-key-gated test runs the full chain against gpt-4o-mini.
The unkeyed test asserts on plumbing only (handler is reached,
503 on bad harness name).
