"""
Round-trip invariant tests for the Omnigent ↔ AgentSpec
adapter.

Asserts
``agent_spec_to_agent_def(agent_def_to_agent_spec(d)) == d`` for
every representative fixture YAML. Translation drift between the
forward and reverse directions fails these tests the moment it
appears.

**Phase 1 dependency.** These tests import
:func:`omnigent.spec.omnigent.agent_spec_to_agent_def`,
which is owned by the phase 1 worktree. Until phase 1 is merged
into the branch this test runs against, the import fails at
collection time — pytest reports a collection error naming the
missing symbol. That is the intended gate: the round-trip test
is written once and becomes meaningful the moment both
directions coexist. No ``pytest.mark.skip`` — per the
omnigent-testing skill, skipped tests rot invisibly. The
collection-time ImportError is the reviewer's signal to merge
phase 1 first.
