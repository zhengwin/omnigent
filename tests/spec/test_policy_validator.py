"""
Tests for validator-layer handling of the guardrails block.

Phase 0 scope: the parser (see ``test_policy_parser.py``) does
all the §13 spec-load rejections loudly. This file covers the
small remaining surface — that ``validate()`` accepts a
well-formed ``AgentSpec`` with guardrails attached, and
doesn't regress existing validation when the new field is
absent.

Runtime-layer cross-field checks (``function.path``
resolvability, label key cross-references) are deferred to
the phase that owns the runtime object — Phase 4 for
FunctionPolicy path resolution.
