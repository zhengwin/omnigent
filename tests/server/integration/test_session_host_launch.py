"""Integration tests for the inline host-launch path of ``POST /v1/sessions``.

This is the path the Web UI's New Chat wizard actually hits: the
browser picks a host + workspace + agent and POSTs them to
``/v1/sessions`` in one call, and the server validates the workspace
against the host (``host.stat``), atomically binds a runner, and
sends a ``host.launch_runner`` frame.

The dedicated ``POST /v1/hosts/{id}/runners`` endpoint is covered by
``test_hosts_api.py``. These tests pin the *inline* path's distinct
behavior — in particular its deliberately lenient failure handling:
unlike the dedicated endpoint (which raises 502/504 when the host
declines or times out), session-create still returns 201 with the
runner bound, leaving the session recoverable via reconnect/relaunch.

    This is the fix for the host-restart stuck-bubble bug: a freshly

    native session its transcript forwarder is not watching. If the
