"""Integration tests for BE-2 additions on the session URL surface.

This PR adds two things on top of main's existing ``/v1/sessions/*``
routes:

1. ``search_query`` query param on ``GET /v1/sessions``. Powers the
   sidebar's session search; case-insensitive substring filter on
   ``SqlConversation.title`` via a SQL ``LIKE``. Sessions with a
   ``NULL`` title are excluded when the filter is active.

2. ``DELETE /v1/sessions/{conversation_id}`` alias on the
   conversations router. Main has no DELETE on its sessions
   router, but the UI needs one — the conversations DELETE
   handler already runs the full teardown (tasks, runner-side
   resource cleanup, session files), so the alias just delegates.

Main owns ``GET /v1/sessions``, ``PATCH /v1/sessions/{id}``,
``GET /v1/sessions/{id}/items``, and the ``/v1/sessions/{id}/
comments[/*]`` aliases. Their tests live elsewhere
(``test_routes_sessions_title.py`` for create/patch/title, e2e for
comments). This file pins only the new BE-2 surface.
