"""Tool-calling probe — can the harness call a server-dispatched tool?

Offers one function tool, asks the model to call it, and auto-returns a
result so the turn can complete. Observing a ``response.tool_call`` proves
the harness surfaces tool calls to the server for dispatch; the turn
completing after the result is delivered proves the round-trip closes.

This is the "can it use a tool at all" signal. The finer "Connects to
Omnigent MCP" column (MCP transport vs a non-MCP tool bridge) is a
separate phase-2 dimension; every P0 SDK harness calls tools, only the
transport differs.
