"""Cost-tracking probe — does a completed turn report usage / cost?

Cost tracking is the keystone for cost *policies*: a ``cost_budget`` guardrail
(``omnigent/policies/builtins/cost.py``) is a no-op without usage to measure, so
this probe answers "can the operator see what a turn spent?".

It reads the cumulative usage the server records on the session: ``total_cost_usd``
(priced spend) and ``last_total_tokens`` (token count), surfaced on the session
snapshot (``SessionResponse``) and the ``session.usage`` SSE event. The bench
observes it via ``TurnResult.total_cost_usd`` / ``total_tokens``, which the
server-backed drivers fill from the snapshot after a turn and the wrap driver
fills from the completed turn's ``usage`` when the wrap forwards it.

Verdicts:
- **SUPPORTED** — a USD cost was reported (full cost tracking).
- **PARTIAL** — tokens reported but no priced cost (an unpriced model: usage is
  visible, so a token/budget policy works, but a USD-cost policy cannot price
  it). This matches omnigent's own behavior — an unpriced model makes the cost
  policy fail to ASK/DENY rather than silently allow.
- **SKIPPED** — the transport surfaced no usage at all (e.g. the wrap path when
  the harness forwards none), with the reason; never a false UNSUPPORTED.
