"""The bench orchestrator: run probes across harnesses into a matrix.

Probes *within* a harness are sequential — they share one driver/session with
a single in-flight turn per conversation. Harnesses run one at a time by
default (``jobs=1``); ``jobs>1`` runs up to N concurrently, bounded by a
semaphore, to cut wall-clock while keeping process/gateway load capped. Under a
parallel run, full-server harnesses share one server+runner (see
:func:`_maybe_shared_full_server`) rather than each booting their own.
